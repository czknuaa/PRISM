</h1>
#  Getting Started
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
> Please note that you need to strictly follow the steps: **Modify `mplib` Library Code** and **Download Assert**.
See [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) for installation instructions.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Usage 
## 1. Task Running and Data Collection
Running the following command will first search for a random seed for the target collection quantity (default is 100), and then replay the seed to collect data.
```
bash run_task.sh ${task_name} ${gpu_id}
```
## 2. Training PRISM
Then, move to `policy/PRISM-Policy` first, and run the following code to train DP3:
```
bash train.sh ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash train.sh block_hammer_beat L515 100 0 0
```
## 3. Evaluating PRISM
Run the following code to evaluate PRISM for a specific task:
```
bash eval.sh ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num} ${checkpoint_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash eval.sh block_hammer_beat L515 100 3000 0 0
```
